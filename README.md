# Lifesteps API

I created this simple backend app for [my website](https://github.com/ochan12/my-website). 
The models I used where thought mainly in a professional work environment, but it could be extended
to other uses. 
Not the greatest of apps but allowed me to discover Kotlin server side. At some point it could
be able to be used my multiple users with their own data.
